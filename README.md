In 2022, our team embarked on a mission to transform the way you code with your personal micro-repo.

With the debut release of our Flagship Desktop App, we laid the foundation, and now our Obsidian plugin is here to revolutionize your coding workflow further by incorporating key capabilities and our users' favorite features directly into their Obsidian environment.

Pieces Copilot for Obsidian is here to elevate your coding and problem-solving experience. Interact with the Copilot directly in any Obsidian workspace. Ask questions about code or content within a file, gain insights on patterns or keywords in code snippets, request the Copilot to generate samples using an SDK you're exploring, and even use it to navigate through PRs.

As you progress through your workflow, the Pieces for Developers Obsidian plugin enables you to capture, manage, share, and discover code snippets and other developer materials, like code screenshots, with simple clicks.

Designed to be your ultimate development companion, the Pieces Obsidian plugin transforms your workflow, bringing unparalleled efficiency and organization to your coding experience.
